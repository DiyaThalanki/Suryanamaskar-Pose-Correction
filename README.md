# Suryanamaskar-Pose-Correction
Project Overview
The Surya Namaskar Pose Correction project is an interactive tool that assists users in performing the Surya Namaskar sequence accurately. Using Three.js for web-based 3D visualization and Blender for pose modeling, this tool provides real-time feedback on the userâ€™s poses. As the user performs each pose, the system checks alignment against a pre-defined outline. If the pose matches the target, it advances to the next asana. Otherwise, it prompts the user to correct their alignment.

Features
Real-time Pose Detection: Tracks user movements and provides immediate feedback.
3D Pose Outlines: Visualizes target asanas in 3D for easy reference.
Pose Accuracy Validation: Compares user poses against pre-modeled outlines to validate correctness.
Interactive Workflow: Guides users through the Surya Namaskar sequence step-by-step.


Technologies Used
Three.js: For creating and displaying 3D models in a web environment.
Blender: For modeling and exporting accurate Surya Namaskar poses.
JavaScript: Core scripting language for application logic.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
